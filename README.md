# Getting Started with Frontend 3.0 🚨

## Step by Step 🐾

(Make sure you have the latest version of docker-composer in app-env)

### Build the container
```
cd frontend
docker build -t frontend .
```
project should be running in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Available Scripts 🪄

In the project container, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

To be added

### `npm run build` 

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
